looks like the 11th bit is being used to set the brightness ff is the largest 2 digit hex number 
and thus corresponds to the highest brighness. brightness of 50 shouled be half of that which is 7f
0 should be 0.

Brightness Set To 100

255 // 1 = 255 (0xff)
0xf6 = 246
-31 + 3 + 15 + 4 + 1 + 255 + (-1) = 246 (0xf6) = second to last bit (0xf6)
